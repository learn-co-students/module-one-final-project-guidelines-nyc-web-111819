# Module One Final Project - MTA Status App

For our final project, we've built a Command Line database application to check status of MTA New York City Subway. 

Users are able to sign up/log in, check status of a train by train name or location. Users can also view their search history and clear it. They can also update their password.


APIs used:
* MTA Real-Time Data Feeds (https://datamine.mta.info/)
* NYC Open Data (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/kk4q-3rt2.json)
* ArcGIS Routing API (https://route.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/Route/NAServer/Route_World/solve)
* Bing Maps API (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/documentation)


## Install Instructions

*  fork and clone this repository

*  rake db:seed
*  run the file with bin/run.rb
